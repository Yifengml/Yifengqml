Hello！ My name is Yifeng Peng and I am currently a second year PhD Candidate at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) advised by [Prof. Ying Wang](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/ywang6), co-advised by [Prof. Yuxuan Du](https://yuxuan-du.github.io/) (Nanyang Technological University), [Samuel Yen-Chi Chen](https://www.sycchen.com/home) (Wells Fargo) and [Prof. Zhiding Liang](https://www.innovationadvancedlab.com/) (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute). And I have my undergraduate study at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) advised by [Prof. Jienan Chen](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=uAkKmZUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Bo Yi](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/yibo/en/index.htm).

## Research Interests <i class="fas fa-flask"></i>

My research focuses on two main areas:

### 1. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) <i class="fas fa-atom"></i>
- **Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA/VQE)**: Design and theoretical analysis of parameterised quantum circuits for eigenvalue estimation, combinatorial optimisation, and quantum‐enhanced model training on NISQ hardware.
- **Machine-Learning Methods for Quantum Systems**: Application of reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, and Bayesian optimisation to circuit synthesis, noise mitigation, error correction, and device calibration.
- **Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning**:  Development of quantum feature maps, kernels, and neural networks that exploit superposition and entanglement to reduce sample complexity and accelerate inference under realistic noise models.

### 2. Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) <i class="fas fa-brain"></i>
- **AI–Quantum Co-Design**: Formulating novel learning paradigms that tightly integrate classical AI models with non-classical resources (superposition, entanglement) to enhance expressivity, sample efficiency, and trainability on NISQ devices.
- **Quantum-Accelerated Optimisation for AI**: Investigating variational and quantum-inspired heuristics (e.g., QAOA-style schedulers, quantum annealing mappings) to speed up large-scale hyper-parameter search, neural architecture search, and combinatorial reasoning tasks central to modern AI.
- **AI Techniques for Quantum Hardware**: Deploying Large Language Model (LLM) to automate circuit compilation, noise suppression, error-mitigation strategies, and adaptive calibration, thereby improving quantum processor fidelity and throughput.
