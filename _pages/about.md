HelloÔºÅ My name is Yifeng Peng and I am currently a second year Phd Candidate at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/) advised by [Prof. Ying Wang](https://www.stevens.edu/profile/ywang6). And I have my undergraduate study at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) advised by [Prof. Jienan Chen](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=uAkKmZUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Prof. Bo Yi](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/yibo/en/index.htm).

## Research Interests <i class="fas fa-flask"></i>

My research focuses on two main areas:

### 1. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) <i class="fas fa-atom"></i>
- **Harnessing Quantum Computing for ML**: I explore how quantum computing can enhance traditional machine learning models.
- **Quantum Algorithms**: Leveraging quantum algorithms to accelerate processing times.
- **Improved Performance**: Using quantum techniques to boost performance in complex data analysis tasks.

### 2. Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) <i class="fas fa-brain"></i>
- **AI and Quantum Intersection**: Developing novel algorithms at the convergence of AI and quantum computing.
- **Quantum AI Optimization**: Solving AI optimization problems more efficiently with quantum principles.
- **Advanced Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models**: Exploring new possibilities in AI, such as quantum-enhanced DDPM.
